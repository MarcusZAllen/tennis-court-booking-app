# 🎾 Tennis Court Booking App

A script-based tool to aggregate publicly available tennis court booking data across different platforms in London. The goal is to maximize your chances of booking a court — without jumping across multiple outdated websites.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Scrapes availability data from court booking sites like Park Sports or ClubSpark.
- Outputs structured court slot information (court name, date, time, cost).
- (Planned) Displays available slots in a user-friendly frontend (Lovable or Framer).
- (Planned) Allows users to book an available court directly from the website.
- Built for flexibility — start simple and grow into a full product.
